                Odin (Old Norse Óðinn) is the most powerful God in Asgard and he is the chief of the Aesir, in Norse mythology. Odin is sometimes called the all-father or the wanderer, he has, in fact, many names, because he has taken many shapes on various occasions. Odin looks like a sorcerer and may have been an inspiration to Gandalf for J.R.R Tolkien’s books Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit.

                Odin is associated with healing, death, royalty, wisdom, battle, sorcery, poetry, and the runic alphabet. and he is thought to be “the leader of souls”. The modern word “Wednesday” is named after Odin and it comes from the Germanic word Wotan which means “Odin” so Wednesday is “Odin’s day”. Odin lives in the house called Valaskialf, in this house, Odin has a tall tower and in the top of the tower he has a throne called Hlidskialf, from here Odin can see throughout all the nine worlds. Odin is the grandson of Buri the first Æsir, and he is the son of the half-God, half-giant Bestla and Bor.

                Odin has two brothers, Vili and Ve, together with his brothers Odin created the world in Norse mythology. Odin is married to the beautiful Goddess Frigg, together they have the sons Baldr and Hod, but Odin also has others sons. Some of the giantesses who lives in Jotunheim (the land of the giants), is so beautiful that even Odin could not resist them. So Odin has on many occasions traveled to Jotunheim to be with one of those beautiful giantesses.
                
                This has resulted in that Odin became the father of Thor (the God of thunder) with the giantess Jörð which means earth, you may also know her under the name Fjörgyn. Odin and the giantess Grid also have a son named Vidar. Odin and the giantess Rind also have a son named Vali.

<h3>
        The Allfather
</h3>
<p class="allfather">

        One of Odin’s countless names is “Allfather” (Old Norse Alfaðir), “because,” according to Snorri Sturluson, “he is the father of all of the gods.”[20] And, as we’ve already noted, Odin is listed as the divine ancestor of countless families from all over northern Europe. He’s simultaneously an Aesir god, a Vanir god (the Vanir god Odr is only an extension or transposition of Odin), and a giant (his mother is Bestla, one of the first frost-giants). One Old Norse poem even identifies him with önd, the breath of life.[22]

        What can we discern in all of this regarding Odin’s identity? In the same way that Thor is the divine force whose presence the Vikings felt in the thunder, Odin is the divine force whose presence the Vikings felt in óðr. To them, this inspiration/fury/ecstasy was not a profane phenomenon, but a sacred and even divine one that lay at the heart of countless different undertakings, including many that were both especially rarefied and especially decisive in the Vikings’ lives. This is perhaps why Odin is the chieftain of the gods – the realms of life over which he presided were to the other aspects of life what a ruler is to common people.
        
        The Norse saw their gods as the vital forces that held the cosmos together. As the “Allfather,” Odin was the vital force of vital forces – the “breath of life,” or something almost akin to Nietzsche’s “Will to Power.” It’s surely no accident that Odin played a greater role than any other god in the creation of the world. Without his vivifying ecstasy, and the enchantment, insight, and clarity that it brings, life – and in particular a life worth living – would be impossible.

<h3> Powers </h3>
<p class="powers">
        Odin is able to shapeshift just like Loki, and he can shapeshift into an animal or human anytime he wants. Odin mostly speaks in phrases and riddles, and Odin’s voice is so soft that all who hears him speak thinks all he says is true. Odin can also just say a single word and he will be blowing out the flames of a fire, or tone down waves of the sea. Odin is seldom active in a battle but when he is, he can make his enemies blind in combat, deaf or horror-struck, Odin can even make their weapons hit like sticks, or make his own men as strong as a bear and go berserk.

        Odin can predict the fade of all humans, and see their past, he even knows that one day Ragnarok (Ragnarök) will start and there is nothing he can do to prevent it. Odin also has the ability to travel to remote lands, in his or in the memories of others. Odin can send people to their death or give them an illness. Some Vikings sacrificed to Odin, and gave him good promises, in the hopes to gain insight into whether they could win a battle or not.
